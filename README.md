## Features

### Core Visualization
- **3D Flight Path**: Interactive 3D visualization of albatross flight patterns
- **Sensor Charts**: Real-time magnetometer and accelerometer data visualization
- **Time Selection**: Click and drag on charts to focus on specific time ranges
- **Altitude Coloring**: Flight path colored by altitude ranges
- **Interactive Navigation**: Previous/Next segment navigation
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed sensor information on hover
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for different screen sizes

### ‚≠ê NEW: Large File Optimization
- **Streaming File Processing**: Handles files up to 200MB+ without freezing
- **Smart Data Sampling**: Automatically adjusts detail level based on file size
- **Background Processing**: Uses Web Workers to keep UI responsive
- **Real-time Progress**: Shows detailed progress with row counts and percentages
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized memory usage (300-500MB for 90MB files)
- **No Browser Freeze**: UI stays interactive during processing
- **Fast Load Times**: 10-15 seconds for 90MB files

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Choose CSV File" and select your data file (supports up to 200MB+)
   - **Sample CSV files are available in the `assets/` folder** (`detailed.csv` and `combined.csv`)
3. Watch the real-time progress as your file loads
4. Interact with the 3D visualization using mouse controls
5. Select time ranges on the charts to focus the 3D view
6. Use navigation buttons to move through flight segments
7. Hover over flight paths for detailed sensor data

### For Large Files (50MB+)
- Processing may take 10-30 seconds - this is normal!
- Watch the progress indicator for detailed status
- Don't refresh the page during processing
- Use Chrome or Edge for best performance
- See `QUICK_START.md` for tips and troubleshooting
